# master thesis project : object detection in AR

Category: Software development

Scope: Two students, 20 weeks each

Augmented Reality is predicted to change the way we interact with the world. Through a transparent UI, the user can receive instructions, communicate with other parties, get feedback and deep dive into context specific information without ever taking her eyes off the task at hand. One of the most important part of AR is the ability to detect, identify and interact with the objects around us. We want to explore the ability to detect, track and identify objects, and to use that information to service the user with instructions on how to use that object.

### Prerequisites

The system will most likely comprise of several different components that need to interact to accomplish the goal:
- The AR device
- The system(s) running object detection/tracking algorithms and object identification algorithms.
- The backend service with domain specific data, such as instructions for different types of objects.

Example of technologies available for use:
- [Apple AR-kit](https://developer.apple.com/arkit/)
- [HoloLens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens)
- [ARCore](https://developers.google.com/ar/)
- [AWS Recognition](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/)
- [Google Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/)
- [Azure Computer Vision API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/)
- [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/)

One of the task of the master thesis will be to iteratively evaluate the requirements and components of the system based on the findings throughout the project.

#### Suggestion 1

Use the AR solution to identify the parts of a predefined IKEA product, and instruct the user on how to assemble it.

#### Suggestion 2

Use the AR solution to detect a specific model of a network device (such as a router), and instruct the user on how to hack into it using known information about that model.

#### Suggestion 3

Your own idea.
