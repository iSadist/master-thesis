\section*{Abstract}
Augmented reality is a field which is getting increased funding every year, as more businesses are realizing the potential of rendering virtual objects in the real world. As the equipment gets more commercialized, the costs will get lowered while performance also goes up. As of now, augmented reality only makes use of plane detection and marker detection to find and locate objects. We want to incorporate machine learning using deep neural networks to be able to find objects in an augmented reality scene. 

In this report we go through the process of developing an an iOS application, which incorporates use of object detection, object recognition and augmented reality. Our goal is to identify if the combination of these field is both feasible and desirable with modern tools available.The application is supposed to work as an alternative to conventional assembly manuals for furniture. 

The final product makes use of \textit{ARKit} developed by \textit{Apple} to render the augmented reality scene, and \textit{Apple's} \textit{Turi Create} to train a neural network for object detection and classifier. 

We then evaluate the performance by having users of various backgrounds perform user tests. We conclude that modern technology makes our idea possible and the user tests shows that the concept has great potential and is desirable.
