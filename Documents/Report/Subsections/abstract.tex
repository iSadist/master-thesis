\section*{Abstract}
In this report we go through the process of developing an an iOS application, which incorporates use of object detection, object recognition and augmented reality. Our goal is to identify if the combination of these field is both feasible and desirable with modern tools available.The application is supposed to work as an alternative to conventional assembly manuals for furniture. The report goes through the different methods tried and used to accomplish our goal. The project involves several different fields, which are all introduced and presented throughout the report. 

The final product makes use of \textit{ARKit} developed by \textit{Apple} to render the augmented reality scene, and \textit{Apple's} \textit{Turi Create} to train a neural network for object detection and classifier. 

We then evaluate the results by having users of various backgrounds evaluate the application according to our goals.
