\section{Introduction}
To first get an understanding of why this project was done, it is important for the reader to learn, not only the background of the fields studied, but also about the prospects of the technologies involved.
 At \hyperref[subsec:Background]{3.1} we go through the current and the potential use of these technologies; also what prospects the consumers and the industry has. Later on, at  \hyperref[subsec:PrevStud]{3.2} we go through some of the previous research that has been done in the fields that are studied in the report. This section is then rounded of at \hyperref[subsec:Goal]{3.3} with us telling you what we hoped to achieve with this project and a brief run-down of how.
