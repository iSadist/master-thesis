\section{Introduction}
To first get an understanding of why this project was done, it is important for the reader to learn, not only the background of the fields studied, but also about the prospects of the technologies involved.
 At \hyperref[subsecBackground]{3.1} we go through the current and the potential use of these technologies; also what prospects the consumers and the industry has. Later on, at  \hyperref[subsecPrevStud]{3.2} we go through some of the previous research that has been done in the fields that are studied in the report. This section is then rounded of at \hyperref[subsecGoal]{3.3} with us telling you what we hoped to achieve with this project and a brief run-down of how.

\subsection{Background}
\label{subsecBackground}
The idea of Augmented Reality is to render virtual object in the real world. This usually requires hardware in the form of a camera and display, a processing unit and software. Common AR devices today are the HoloLens \cite{microsoft}, Google's Glass \cite{googleGlasses} and a vast amount of mobile devices, such as Apple's iPhone X \cite{appleAR}. 

The general interest for AR has undeniably grown in recent years, with mobile games and applications such as Niantic's Pokémon Go \cite{pokemonGO} and IKEA's IKEA Place \cite{IKEAPlace} the AR industry has peaked a general interest and sources speculate it could be a \$90 million dollar industry by 2022 \cite{digi-capital}.
 But Augmented Reality has not only reached the casual users; the technology has also peaked an interest in several industries. One such project is Fieldbit's Fieldbit Hero \cite{fieldbit}, a platform enabling technicians to get instant AR annotations to their AR devices from an engineer, allowing the technician to get visual instructions while simultaneously  being able to work hands-free. 
 
However, as of now, most localization and identification of objects within AR are done using marker detection \cite{markerDetection}. An alternative to this would be to use \textit{Deep Neural Networks}, as they have been proven to be very useful for object detection in images. The hype around neural networks have been particularly strong since AlexNet scored high in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 challenge and the ImageNet ILSVRC-2012 challenge \cite{NIPS2012_4824}. They accomplished these feats by making use of new methods, e.g. \textit{dropout}. Since then several different types of network models have been created. Now we have network models that can detect both where an object is in an image, and what the object is, in one go. One such network is \textit{YOLO}\cite{YOLO1}. By adopting such a network, the need for having to mark objects would drop significantly and it would open up for many more possible use cases for AR.
 
\subsection{Previous studies}
\label{subsecPrevStud}
D. Chatzopoulos et al.(2017) describes the basics of Mobile Augmented Reality, its advancements and it's flaws. They estimate that MAR is the most promising field of mobile applications and that it will have a massive impact on how we interact with the real world. However, they also go through some of the current hiccoughs with the technology, such as bandwith limitation and the computing power required. 
\cite{MARS}

S.Gould et al.(2009) writes about a hierarchical model for joint object detection and image segmentation, where they basically tried to segment all objects in an image and classifies every pixel. 
\cite{NIPS2009_3766}


Y LeCun and M.A. Ranzato goes in-depth on the history and progress of deep learning, from the first machine learning model, the Perceptron, to future challenges with deep learning. They write about the use cases for machine learning and how models generally work. They also classify different kinds of models into separate categories. Also written about is areas such as what makes a good feature and how convolutional neural networks are constructed.

\subsection{The goal of this project}
\label{subsecGoal}
When working with Augmented Reality it is obviously interesting to know where planes are and how the camera moves in the scene to be able to render virtual object. But usually there is more than one single plane in ones environment. Usually there are other objects in the scene that affects how the virtual objects should be rendered. Sometimes maybe the virtual objects could interact with the real objects to make a more realistic scene. Because of this it can be very interesting to know what those objects actually are.

For example, if you are going to place a virtual furniture in your home it would be good to detect other furnitures in the area so that the virtual object can collide with the real object. This way, they will not intertwine with each other.

% Our master thesis
Or maybe one would like to give virtual instructions to a user for assembling or constructing a certain product or to do maintenance. It is then important to figure out what 3D objects there are in the scene to be able to render instructions on the right places.

Augmented Reality technology has come a long way, but there are still things missing for making it a genuine experience. In ARKit, for instance, if a virtual object is rendered on top of a plane and a real object come in between the virtual object will still be rendered first. This makes it painfully obvious that the virtual object is just a 2D drawing on the screen.

Our goal is to try to combine Augmented Reality with Object detection and Object recognition to see if there is a possibility to create something valuable out of this. This report will investigate both the performance possibilities and the creative possibilities as well as research the current tools and try to push them to their limits.

A QUOTE FROM JAYWAY ABOUT WHO THEY ARE \\

The purpose for Jayway in this project is mainly to explore Object Recognition, ARKit and how they can be combined together to create value. The main question is to know, if possible, how easy it is to implement a solution.
Jayway is continuously looking to explore new technologies and Augmented Reality is a hot new trend emerging in the markets in the time of writing this report.
A second objective is for Jayway to take the finished implementation to one of their customers and
present an example of what they are able to do for their customers.
