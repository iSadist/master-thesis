\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Summary}

\subsection{Future Work}
Because of the rapid development in the fields discussed in this report, much of what we've gone through could be improved in the future. With new \textit{Augmented Reality} and \textit{Mixed Reality} hardware being developed by big franchises, such as Facebook \cite{facebookAR}, the performance will increase ever so rapidly. 
One improvement of our application would be to port it to, not only hand-held devices, but also the headgear, thus allowing the user to building with both hands and never have to pause during the assembly process. 

The model used also only included the pieces to one furniture, but one could easily include more in the future by gathering data for other furniture parts. 

Another issue with our model is that we are unable to detect screws and bolts because of their comparatively small size, instead, we just inform the user that screws should be used during a particular step using animations. This issue could possibly be fixed by adapting our model into taking account to smaller objects.
